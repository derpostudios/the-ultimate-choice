WARNING: this program CAN and WILL turn off your PC if the wrong choice is made. It is highly reccomended to save all 
unsaved progress on any other program before running.

DO NOT run this program and then immediately update your device. This can cause damage to the hard drive.

There are two programs, the first one (the_ultimate_choice_win10.exe) will only work on windows 10 pro and some earlier
versions. The second, (the_ultimate_choice_win11.exe) will work on all versions of windows but with one major difference.
The windows 10 version will occasionally create popup messages, the windows 11 version will not create popup messages, but 
instead put the text in the console. This is because windows 10 pro has a file called msg.exe, but most other versions do 
not. msg.exe allows for the command prompt to create popups.

running the program.mp4 is a video that shows what the program can do, Unlimited bacon and no games_ (Original).mp4 is what 
the main joke of the program is based off of. Credits to Chuckle Sandwich.
